WLOG we will say that we are trying to MAXIMIZE a solution.
[If looking to MINIMIZE, change "max" to "min"
and ">" to "<"]

Let n be the number of variables/the number of dimensions.
Let M be an 1xn matrix, representing the function we would like to max.
Let V be a vector of vectors, representing the vertices of our graph.
[The size of each sub-vector will be n]

max = 0
[This will always be our initialization, since the origin is the first point we test.]

For v in V:
	test = 0
	index = 0

	For m in M:
		test += m*v[index]
		index++

	If test > max:
		max = test
	Else:
		return v
